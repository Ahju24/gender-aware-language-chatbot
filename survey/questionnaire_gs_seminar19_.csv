"Ins"			"Welcome to this study on <strong>gender-aware language in chatbot interactions</strong>.

We’re conducting research on how the use of gender-specific versus gender-neutral language in chatbot communication influences user engagement.

<strong>Procedure</strong>

In this study, you’ll briefly talk to the chatbot “StyleBot” that provides outfit suggestions based on a few details you provide.
Your task is simple: you’ll choose a scenario, and StyleBot will suggest clothing options based on the context and your preferences.
After the chatbot conversation, you’ll be asked to complete a brief follow-up survey about your engagement.

<strong>Duration</strong>

The entire process should only take about <strong>5 minutes</strong>.

<strong>Anonymity & Voluntary participation</strong>

Your responses are completely <strong>anonymous</strong> and will be used only for academic purposes as part of a university seminar project. The study does not collect any personally identifying data. Participation is <strong>voluntary</strong>, and you may stop at any time.
